# Mock Exam 3 - 10

## Task: Scale Deployment

We have created a new deployment called nginx-deploy. Scale the deployment to 3 replicas. Has the number of replicas increased? Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

## Requirements:

- Does the deployment have 3 replicas?

## Documentation:

- [Kubernetes Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
- [Kubernetes Scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment)

## Solution Steps

Use the command kubectl scale to increase the replica count to 3.

```bash
kubectl scale deploy nginx-deploy --replicas=3
```

The controller-manager is responsible for scaling up pods of a replicaset. If you inspect the control plane components in the kube-system namespace, you will see that the controller-manager is not running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

The command running inside the controller-manager pod is incorrect.
After fix all the values in the file and wait for controller-manager pod to restart.

Alternatively, you can run sed command to change all values at once:

```bash
sed -i 's/kube-contro1ler-manager/kube-controller-manager/g' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
```

This will fix the issues in controller-manager yaml file.

At last, inspect the deployment by using below command, you should see 3/3 under READY if the fix above was properly performed. Example:

```bash
kubectl get deploy
```

```bash
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deploy   3/3     3            3           6m2s
```
